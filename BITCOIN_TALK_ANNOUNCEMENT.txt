BOOK: The Anti-Scam, De-risking, Community Run Altcoin
What in the world is BOOK?
BOOK is a direct continuation of the coin once known as EDEN. On [April 4?], the developer of EDEN, iodev, ran off with almost [16 btc?] worth of investment money that was to be used for exchanges, listings, and devlopments. Today, the community's response to this terrible incident is the birth of a new coin, headed by theBeard.be (a trusted escrow on Discord): BOOK. 
How will BOOK help stop scams from occuring?
1. New and current Altcoins will have the opportunity to list on the book.io website with any amount of collateral in BOOK. There will be no maximum or minimum.
2. On book.io, anyone can publicly view the collateral offered by the developer.
3. It is then up to the investor whether he wants to invest. Should the dev run away with the investor's money, scam victims may exchange their coins for a portion the BOOK collateral. (these exchanges will be verified and users will have a [week?] to submit their complaints.
BOOK will be the altcoin that ends developer scamming:
a) Investors will have the opportunity to view publicly offered collateral
b) There is a scam-watch channel in the current Discord to help advise investors of possible scams
c) There is a #scam-stories channel [or scam stories section of the website..], where scam victims may publicly post their scam stories, whether it be by a developer or Discord user, and post donation addresses for community members to help.
